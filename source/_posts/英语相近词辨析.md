## A

**amortized vs. average**

> Amortized time complexity is a worst-case estimate but considered over many repeated operations. If an operation has  O(f(n))  amortized time complexity, then individual operations may take more time than  O(f(n)) , but the mean time taken by a larger number of operations will be  O(f(n)) , over any input.

> Average-case time complexity instead assumes that all inputs are equally likely. Some individual inputs may be worse than  O(f(n)) , but an input chosen at random will take time with expected value  O(f(n)) . A related notion is expected time complexity, which can refer either to assuming a random input or to randomizing the operation of the algorithm.

- amortized complexity 分摊复杂度，在任意输入下重复很多次一个操作，有时候某个操作非常费时，但如果将时间均摊到每一次操作成本其实不一定很高
- average complexity 平均复杂度，表示在不同输入下的复杂度的一种加权，是一种近似概率加权的模型

## M

**memorization vs. memoization**

>As nouns the difference between memorization and memoization is that *memorization* is the act of committing something to memory or memorizing while *memoization* is (computer science) a technique in which partial results are recorded (forming a memo) and then can be re-used later without having to recompute them.

- memorization 是常用名词‘记忆’，指代一般人脑的记忆活动
- memoization 是计算机名词，特指为了后续使用便捷，将某些数据存储的过程

备注：在fib递归的改进中遇到


## R

**recursion vs. recurrence**

>Recursion is a related term of recurrence. Recurrence is a related term of recursion.
As nouns the difference between recurrence and recursion is that *recurrence* is return or reversion to a certain state while *recursion* is the act of recurring.

- recurrence 指的是返回值或者递归结果本身，可以翻译为‘迭代结果’
- recursion 指的是迭代过程本身

recursion trace 迭代追踪：绘制出迭代过程的图解

recurrence equation 递推方程：对递归模式进行数学归纳，例如

$$
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)
$$

备注：迭代分析的两种方法
